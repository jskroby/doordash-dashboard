## Code Generation

Qodo Gen Code Generation and Completion is a powerful tool designed to accelerate your coding process, reducing the need for repetitive tasks such as copying and pasting code snippets from the internet.  
By enabling Code Completion, Qodo Gen learns from your codebase and provides real-time suggestions that seamlessly integrate with your writing flow.

As you type, Qodo Gen analyzes your code in real-time to grasp your intention. It then presents code completions and suggestions aimed to complete your current line of code or offers snippets that fit the context of your work.

Code Completion is a Pro feature, exclusively available for Teams and Enterprise users. [Visit Qodo's website to learn more.](https://www.qodo.ai/glossary/ai-code-completion/)
